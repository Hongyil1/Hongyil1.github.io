# Sorting and Searching
## Searching
### The Sequential Search
The following image shows the process of sequential search:

**Analysis of Sequential Search**

For searching, it makes sense to count the number of comparisons performed. The time complexity is **O(n)**.

| **Case** | **Best Case** | **Worst Case** | **Average Case** |
|:--------|:-------------|:--------------|:----------------|
| item is present| 1 | n | n/2 |
| item is not present | n | n | n |

**Sorting** the list before doing the seach will increase the efficiency. However, this technique is still **O(n)**.
