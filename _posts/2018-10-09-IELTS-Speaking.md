# Lesson 1
## Timeing:
- 11 to 14 minutes overall
- timeing is very strict

**Part 1**: 4 to 5 minutes; **Part 2**: 3 to 4 minutes; **Part 3**: 4 to 5 minutes.

## Scoring ststem
- 4 scores, 25% each
1. Fluency and coherence: Can you answer the questions fluently? Doese your answer make sense?
2. Vocabulary: The examiers are looking to see if you use any good language in your answer.
3. Grammar: Complex grammar is not what examier looking for.  The grammar score is always trying to avoid making too many mistakes.
4. Pronunciation: It dosen't mean **accent**. The pronuciation is about how clear you pronuce your words and phases.

## Some tips:
- be ready
- know what to expect: what will happen in the speaking test.
- know what the examiner expects from you: don't give long anser in Part 1.
- Natural language, not difficult language: Difficult words or grammar will make you stop and slow you down.
- Answer as quickly as you can: Say the first thing that comes into your mind. Avoid hesitation. The examiner won't judge the quality of your answer.

## Don't worry about:
- body language
- eye contact
- the quality of your ideas
- whether the examier agrees with you

# Lesson 2
## Speaking part 1
- 4 to 5 minutes
- 10 or 11 questions
- 3 topic areas will be covered: 2 or 3 introduction questions, 4 on one topic, 4 on the other.

## Keys in part 1
- try to show **fluency**
- don't stop and think
- don't worry about vocabulary or grammar: Aviod grammar mistakes. But don't show off your vocabulary or complex grammar in part 1. 
- it's an easy warm-up: You **can't** get high score from part 1

## The best technique for part 1
- Answer the question then give a reason
- Give short, simple answers but use full sentences, not just one word
- Stop with confidence: don't fill the silence after the answer. don't keep talking and smile at the examiner. To show I have finished my answer and I'm ready for next question.

## Topics: often seem childish
e.g. What's your favourite colour?

My favourite colour is blue because it's the color of sky on a nice day.

**A good way to practise:**

Do you like ...? : games, walking, gardens, flowers, dancing

Do you think it's better to watch sports or play them yourself?
