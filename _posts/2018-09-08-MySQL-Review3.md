# MySQL constraints
### Priamary key constraint
A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. You must follow the rules below when you define a primary key for a table:
* A primary key must contain unique values. If the primary key consists of multiple columns, the combination of values in these columns must be unique.
* A primary key column cannot contain NULL values. It means that you have to declare the primary key column with the NOT NULL  attribute. If you donâ€™t, MySQL will force the primary key column as NOT NULL  implicitly.
* A table has only one primary key.

A primary key column often has the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute that generates a unique sequence for the key automatically. The primary key of the next row is greater than the previous one.

**PRIMARY KEY vs. UNIQUE KEY vs. KEY**

A *KEY* is a synonym for INDEX. You use the KEY when you want to create an index for a column or a set of columns that is not the part of a primary key or unique key.

A *UNIQUE* index creates a constraint for a column whose values must be unique. Unlike the PRIMARY index, MySQL allows NULL values in the UNIQUE index. A table can also have multiple UNIQUE indexes.

### Foreign key
A foreign key is a field in a table that matches another field of another table. A foreign key places constraints on data in the related tables, which enables MySQL to maintain referential integrity.

A foreign key can be a column or a set of columns. The columns in the child table often refer to the primary key columns in the parent table. A table may have more than one foreign key, and each foreign key in the child table may refer to a different parent table.

Sometimes, the child and parent tables are the same. The foreign key refers back to the primary key of the table e.g., the following employees table.
